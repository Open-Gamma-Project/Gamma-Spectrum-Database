Made free and open-source by [NuclearPhoenix](https://nuclearphoenix.xyz) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

This site is part of the [Open Gamma Project](https://github.com/Open-Gamma-Project) to provide modern and open-source resources for accessible gamma-spectroscopy. Many thanks to all of the people that helped in creating this database and especially for providing all of the spetra data!

Want to submit a specific radioisotope? Awesome! Please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Open-Gamma-Project/Gamma-Spectrum-Database) with your spectrum.
